## Naive Bayes classifiers 
are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.

To start with, let us consider a dataset.
## Data test
