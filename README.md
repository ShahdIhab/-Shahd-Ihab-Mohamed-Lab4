## Naive Bayes classifiers 
Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.

## Libraries that is used
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import seaborn as sns

To start with, let us consider a dataset.

### Text data set
df = pd.read_csv('binclass.txt') 
df.columns = ["positive", "negative", "y"]
